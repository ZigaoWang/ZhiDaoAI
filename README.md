#### GET /api/daily-digest

Get personalized daily research digests based on subscribed topics.

**Query Parameters:**
- `topics` (string): The topics to receive research updates about
- `userId` (string, optional): User identifier for personalization

**Response:**
- `200 OK`: Returns the personalized research digest
- `400 Bad Request`: Missing topics parameter
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Error generating the digest

#### POST /question

## Environment Variables

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will listen (default: 3000)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The API key for accessing the UniAPI (OpenAI) endpoint
- `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (e.g., `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`)

## Logging

The server uses a custom logging function with the following log levels:
- `ERROR`
- `WARN`
- `INFO`
- `DEBUG`

The current log level is determined by the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
3. Access the endpoints as described above
